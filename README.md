# Experiments for digital #inktober 2020
 
Explorations on cross-hatching, engraving, and similar non-photorealistic rendering.

Build with WebGL and three.js. GLSL syntax is WebGL2, so won't work on Safari (try Safari Technology Preview).
Not created with performance in mind, some might be too slow for mobile!
